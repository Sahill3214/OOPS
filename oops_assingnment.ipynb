        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes and Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class can have.\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class, containing actual data based on the class's definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is typically achieved using access modifiers (like private, protected, and public).\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a new class (subclass/child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass/parent class). This promotes code reuse and helps in hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions. It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same function call in different ways, either through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) or method overriding (runtime polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on relevant attributes and behaviors, while hiding unnecessary details. This is typically achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define the methods that derived classes must implement.\n",
        "These concepts together help in designing modular, reusable, and maintainable code."
